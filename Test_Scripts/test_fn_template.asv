% Comment

% @Fabian or @Sam for a comment for the other person 


% E.g:
%% %% 1D examples
%% Example 1
2+2
% @Fabian This example seems unclear... :)

%% Example 2

% Note that each example should have it's own %% subheading section so that
% it is easy to run the examples one by one.

% Note that heading and subheading should start with a capital letter

% Within a given subheading section if you do multiple plots they should be
% separate figures or use subplot. I think we should use subplot much more.
% As it's annoying to have too many figure pop up and hard to compare
% things.
